## 🌟 Task 2: Mastering the Art of Low-Code Data Mining with PyCaret 🌟

### 📌 Introduction:
[PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/) is your trusty 🛠 low-code machine learning wand in Python. From data prep to model deployment, it's a whirlwind tour that lasts mere seconds.

### 🚀 Tasks & Steps:

#### a) 🎖 Classification:
1. 🕵️ Binary Classification
2. 🌈 Multiclass Classification
3. 📉 Regression

#### b) 🧩 Clustering

#### c) 🚨 Anomaly Detection

#### d) 🛍 Association Rules Mining

#### e) ⏲ Time Series Forecasting:
1. Solo Mode: Univariate without Exogenous Variables
2. Party Mode: Univariate with Exogenous Variables

For each delightful task:
1. 🌐 Fetch a dataset from Kaggle or any treasure trove (but remember, no copying from official PyCaret chests!).
2. 📥 Load the dataset into your Python realm.
3. 🧙 Use PyCaret's `setup()` spell with `use_gpu=True` (if the stars align).
4. 🌀 Run and evaluate your models in the swirling PyCaret cauldron.

### 🎨 Gradio Demos:
[Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/), the painter's palette 🎨 of machine learning. Craft at least two masterpieces using Gradio for your PyCaret models.
