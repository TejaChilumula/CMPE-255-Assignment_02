## 🚀 Assignment 2: Dive Deep into Data Mining with PyCaret 🚀

### 📘 Introduction:
Embrace the power of [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/) 🌌, an efficient low-code machine learning library in Python. 🐍 While exploring, ensure to venture into new territories and avoid replicating from the official PyCaret examples. Remember, the guardian Turnitin 🦉 watches over all!

### 🛠 Setup & Pre-requisites:

1. **Environment Initialization** 🌍:
   - Boot up a Jupyter or Google Colab 📓 environment.
   - In Google Colab, enable the GPU prowess by navigating to `Runtime > Change runtime type` and selecting `GPU` 🎮.
   - Ensure all necessary packages, especially PyCaret, are at their latest versions.

2. **Dataset Treasure Hunt** 🗺:
   - Dive into [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or tap into other data reservoirs.
   - Double-check that your chosen datasets haven't been featured in official PyCaret demos or course materials.

### 💡 Tasks & Experiments:

#### a) Mastering Classification 🏆:

   - **Binary Classification** 🔄:
      - Deploy algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Support Vector Machines to categorize into two classes.
      
   - **Multiclass Classification** 🌈:
      - Harness algorithms like Random Forest, Neural Networks, or Gradient Boosting Machines to segregate into multiple categories.
      
   - **Regression Analysis** 📈:
      - Predict continuous outcomes using Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, or Ensemble techniques.

#### b) The Art of Clustering 🧭:

   - Group data using techniques like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN to unveil inherent patterns.

#### c) Unearthing Anomalies 🔍:

   - Use the likes of Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or Autoencoders to pinpoint rare data points or outliers.

#### d) Deciphering Association Rules 🧬:

   - Decode hidden patterns using algorithms such as Apriori or Eclat.

#### e) Time Series Prophecies ⏳:

   - **Univariate without Exogenous Variables** 🚶:
      - Forecast the future with ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or Prophet.
      
   - **Univariate with Exogenous Helpers** 🏃‍♂️:
      - Add external variables to refine predictions using compatible algorithms.

### 📖 Documentation & Tales:

- Chronicle 📜 every step, from data preprocessing ⚙️, model tuning 🔧, to final evaluations 📊.
- Illuminate your journey with vibrant visualizations 📉 and performance metrics.
- Conclude with pearls of wisdom 🌟, potential enhancements 🔍, and encountered challenges ⛔.
